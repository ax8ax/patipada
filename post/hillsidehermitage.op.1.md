This document: [grazing and ruminating the pastures of the dhammapada](https://github.com/ax8ax/patipada/blob/main/post/hillsidehermitage.op.1.attachment.md) wants to serve as an introduction for beginners to the teaching of the buddha. The main goal is to provide a practical approach for applying the dhamma, and a loose layout for structuring the teachings of the buddha.

I wrote it having the lovely community of r/streamentry in mind. \[IMHO\] It honestly reflects what I have learned from applying the concrete verses of the dhammapada coupled with the wide context of the suttas, interpreted through the lenses of Hillside Hermitage \[relying mainly in the two last books of Ajahn Nyanamoli\].

I think it may be specially helpful to the practitioners who have trouble either with too much proliferation about the teachings of the dhamma, or with applying too little the teachings of the dhamma in the real life.

Be warned; I am sure it contains lots of errors coming from my poorly understanding of the dhamma.

The main motivation of this document was to sort out for myself what I learned, and some thoughts about the practice. The ulterior motivation for posting it here, though, is not other than to receive feedback and be corrected... as I am sure that in the several place where I have spilled out my ignorance.
