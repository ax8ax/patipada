[This document: grazing and ruminating the pastures of the dhammapada](https://github.com/ax8ax/patipada/blob/main/post/hillsidehermitage.op.1.attachment.md) wants to serve as an introduction for beginners to the teaching of the buddha. The main goal is to provide a practical approach for structuring the teachings of the buddha.

I wrote it having the lovely community of `r/streamentry` in mind. [IMHO] It honestly reflects what I have learned from applying the teachings of the dhammapada within the context of the suttas as interpreted by Hillside Hermitage; mainly the two last books of Ajahn Nyanamoli.

I think it may be specially helpful to the ones who have trouble either with too much proliferation about the teachings of the dhamma, or to apply too little the teachings of the dhamma in the real life.

That said, I am sure it contains lots of errors coming from my poorly understanding of the dhamma.

The only motivation of this document was to sort out for myself what I learned, and some thoughts about the practice... The ulterior motivation for posting it here, though, is not other than to be corrected... as I am sure that in the several place where, due not knowing better, I have spilled out many errors.
