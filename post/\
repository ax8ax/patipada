[:title: `subject` [ grazing and ruminating the pastures of the dhammapada .. to reach stream entry ] :title:]

The teachings in three simple `pada` [a step covering a quarter] from three different `sutta` [well taught threads of truth], corresponding to the three big stages:

1. `sīla` : don't abandon yourself to no vigilance
2. `samādhi` : be on your guard against bodily agitation, mental agitation, verbal agitation
3. `pañña` : those who bring citta under control are freed from the bonds of Māra

This is an introduction for beginners having the community of `r/streamentry` in mind. It aims to points towards stream entry. It honestly reflect what I have interpreted from HH's teachings, specially the two last books of Ajahn Nyanamoli.

I think it may be specially helpful to the ones who have trouble either with too much proliferation about the teachings of the dhamma, or to apply too little the teachings of the dhamma in the real life.

That said, I am sure it contains lots of errors coming from my poorly understanding of the dhamma.


There were three additional concrete motivations for this document:


`[ 1 ]` The post is explained using the smile of a `video_game`, a `roleplay_game`. I think some people would greatly benefit if they try to role_play all_day to act as buddha himself would act in a vr-chat universe. Larp as a buddha, until you succeed to be like one. This will make you happy.


`[ 2 ]` `streamentry` community loves map. The buddha's teachings lay down two detailed maps to help one to walk from the darkness of ignorance to the freedom from suffering... One of them is completely ignored as a map! Of not use, a mere ornamental piece of pottery. Still... worse, the other, while being recognized as a map, it is looked down as a map! Or at being something very different, and just vaguely related, to the very pointing towards the solution...

In a lot of whathever_buddhism the maps are even looked down. Not just disbelief, but in some point as being suspicious that the buddha, the wheel turning dhamma, and his sādhana, would even encapsulated the *stupid-proof guide_of_how_to pass the game*.

it can be like this ...

> — "It can't be like that, *[ non celibacy is not obtrusive for the one who is not celibate ... ]*"
> 
> — "Whatever. *[ I love music | ... ]*
> 
> — "I like it better like this: *[...]*
> 
> ...
> 
> *[randoms from the suttas that upon hearing the dhamma from the mouth of the buddha made a wrong turn]*

... or like this ...

> when it comes to the Dhamma ,
> 
> we have to understand that our opinions are one thing ;
> 
> the Dhamma is something else .
> 
> *[Ajahn Chah ; in the shape of a circle]*

... which way should we turn in this `[ left Y right]` bifurcation?



`[ 3 ]` In several and different internet communities of users that follow the teachings of the buddha... a big chunk of the practitioners fall hard to apply the very `first_level` instruction from the gradual training, such as keeping the bows on virtue.

Even more people, yet, fail to apply the very first instruction from the dhammapada.

> He abused me, he beat me, he robbed me, he conquer me!
> 
> Those who entertain such thoughts will not still their hatred.
> 
> `[ dhammapada 1 Y2 a ]`

Do they understand that all the dhamma is perfectly defined in the first pair of the dhammapada?

> Experiences are preceded by mind ,
> 
> lead by mind, and produced by mind ;
> 
> if one speaks or acts *[or thinks]* with an impure mind,
> 
> suffering follows,
> 
> even as a cartwheel the hoof of the ox.
> 
> `[ dhammapada 1 Y1 a ]`

.. this or this  ..

> Experiences are preceded by mind,
> 
> lead by mind, and produced by mind.
> 
> If one speaks or acts with a pure mind,
> 
> happiness follows,
> 
> like a shadow that never departs.
> 
> `[ dhammapada 1 Y1 l ]`

Therefore, were one to believe the `dhamma` [natural order, flow, truth], the first thing one would do would be to follow the dhamma, by going against the grain of the world, if needed. Thus, happiness follows, otherwise, nevertheless, suffering follows. It follows in the here-now, and it follows in the there-after.




# ■ oral tradition [context]

The teaching of buddha are few, clear, and expressed in beautiful verses. **The teachings of the buddha were meant to be learned, recited, and followed.** They were not meant to be read, studied, and proliferated intellectually.

If one wants to follow the spirit of the teaching of the buddha, I'd encourage all practitioner to learn by heart the few relevant verses to the stage one is working in. The first three verses are the key for sīla, samādhi, and pañña. If one does not know the teachings, how one is supposed to apply them in real life...? It is not possible to apply them.

There are tons of suttas, but everything emanates from three fundamental concepts that the whole early buddhist texts gravitate about:



## `■` *the micro mechanics of walking*

* where to put one's feet in each step of the path
* `majjhimapaṭipadā` [the middle path of steps of the trainee]
* [see SN 56.11](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11/en/bodhi).



## `■` *the detailed map*

* the detailed-concrete verse-teaching oriented-map that one needs to perform in real life, step by step, to walk the path of the dhamma
* `dhammapada` [the steps of dhamma]
* [see Dhammapada](https://suttacentral.net/dhp).



## `■` *the macro map*

* the detailed skill attainment oriented map that one needs to conquer, step by step, to succeed in walking the path
* `anupubbapaṭipadā` [following east, step by step, path of steps of the trainee]
* [see DN 2](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/bodhi).




# ■ role of similes [visualize , project , self-suggest how to act and meditate]

The similes are there to help one to understand the teachings. The best is to immerse yourself in the simile for a while, and think how would you act in such mini_game. Bring the alertness, vigilance, energy, and interest you get from that simile to apply it to your meditation. Again; larp, it is of great help.


`[ 1. ]` The simile of the dhamma spiritual journey is: the walker and the path.

The goal is to know where on should be heading and how to safely advance step by step in a jungle full of thorns... to reach a place one does not know where it is, if exist at all...


`[ 2. ]` The simile of training and struggling according the dhamma is: the trainer and the wild elephant bull.

The goal is taming a wild jungle elephant so it marches erect, straight, fearless, and full confident towards his death in an epic battle against the army of Māro, seeing non stop of arrows and formations of shields, sounds of conchs and furious battle drums, smell of blood and death...


`[ 3. ]` The simile of the body-mind-background-environment of the training of the dhamma is: the six wild animals the trainer is chained to.

The goal is that the trainer tied to the six wilds animals stays close to them, so the six animals sit down, stay calm, do not disturb anyone, are not being disturbed by anyone else, and there's silence and peace.

Similes are good off cushion, and even better and more effective in a controlled environment conductive to meditate, to do kusala.




# ■ saṃsāra as video game [theory]

**A player** ***passes*** **saṃsāra once stops wanting to play the game.**

The main skill to cultivate is dispassion. The main skill required for passing the game is being uninterested towards all aspects of the game, so eventually one renounce to keep playing, respawn after respawn.

Each `satta` [creature; being] is a player. Each human player is trapped within a `saḷāyatana` [six stretches; six field senses]. This `saḷāyatana` offers to the player a stream of `nāmarūpa` [name form]; all the player can experience from the game are particular instances of `nāmarūpa`.

Each `āyatana` [a stretch] is as powerful as the `vajra` [the thunderbolt; the all mighty weapon of Indra, the Lord of the Gods]. That's why an `āyatana` is also called `indriya` [belonging to Indra]. Unfortunately, the untrained player has no control over such `indriyas`, rather the player is being captive and under the control of the powerful `indriyas`. An `āyatana` is also called an animal... since the senses are alive on their own, have their own wanting, their own likes and dislikes.

In short, an untrained player has the pretension he's master of *this* `satta`, that he leads *this* body from here to there; in fact, he's just being dragged by the wild animals he's chain to, from moment to moment, from life to life. Like in a cartoon, one hits ones face against a hard object every few seconds .. a bit of funny `domanassa`.

Rather than confront the painful reality: *I am being captive by the senses, by the body, I dislike it*, the untrained flips the situation by telling himself *I am the master of the body, this body obeys me, I love it*.



## `■■` āyatana, the six wild animals

From top to bottom, from distant to near, these are the six wild animals.

1. eye, sights, snake. An untrained eye acts like a snake. When he sees something he likes it, he approach serpently to it, surrounds it, hugs it, and try to eat it with his mouth.

2. ear, sounds, crocodile. An untrained ear acts like a crocodile. When he hears something he likes it he catch it with his mouth and won't release it, not matter what.

3. nose, smell, bee. An untrained nose acts like a bee. It goes flying from flower to flower, running away from the stingy ones, and following the sweet fragrances to taste them with his mouth.

4. tongue, taste, dog. An untrained tongue acts like a dog. When there's prospect of food, he starts salivating, and as soon as the tasty food touch his tongue, rather than chewing and delight in the flavour, he can't help it but swallow as soon as possible, so he can put more stuff into his mouth.

5. body, touch, jackal. An untrained body acts like a jackal deceive oneself to assume what one is not. The jackal in India is seen as a cunning and deceptive animal, similar to the role of the red fox in other folklore. While the other four senses cognize many different objects, the feeling of touch only recognizes one object: one's body. Thus, it deceives the player into thinking that this external object owned by the world, the body, it is really an *internal* object, owned by him.

6. mind, dhammas, monkey. An untrained mind acts like a monkey... jumping from branch to branch. This monkey is called `citta`, which is usually translated in English as mind or heart.

buddha says the six stretches are in themselves hollow. They have no constant essence, they just reflect the external objects they are `phassa` [contacted] with. One does not see them, thus one takes them as I and mine. As a result one goes in a never ending quest of chasing the objects of the world... thinking that is what one wishes, not seeing that those wishes come from the wild animals.

While the senses may be empty in themselves, due the habits, influxes, and stains... those wild animals have a clear strong behaviour and gross palpable desires. When they see, hear, smell, taste, touch, imagine something in the range of their pasture... they insta react! When they like such objects, they step out of the `dvāro` [sense door] to delight in them. When they dislike such objects, they step out of the `dvāro` to get rid of them.

The untrained has no clue he is following the wild animals into their pastures, the untrained has no clue when he steps out of the door following the animal, or whether there was a door at all... Since the wild animals always want to go here and there, one is fully scattered chasing the objects from `saṃsāra`.

buddha says there are five differentiable aspects of the senses. These aspects are fundamentally intermixed, these are the `pañcakkhandha` [five aggregates]: `rūpa` form, `sañña` [carrying knowing] perception, `vedanā` [what causes one to feel] feeling, `viññāṇa` [what causes one to know] knowing, `saṅkhāra` [carrying action] actions.

The `ariya` is one who overwheelms rūpa [is not overwheelmed by rūpa], who masters sañña [seeing the repulsive and the no repulsive at will], who endures vedanā [without accumulating], who understands viññāṇa [by not being deceived by it], and who pacify saṅkhāra [by remaining silent]. He has grow dispasionated towards the world. He has grow uninterested with the world.

There are the practical approaches one needs to adopt to tame the six animals with five aggregates.



## `■■` the moves of the game

How do you move your body in real life?

The gamepad of this game is very subtle... it consist of the dupla `< manasikāra , manosaṅkhāra >`. `manasikāra` is the faculty of attention. `manosaṅkhāra` is the faculty of intention, which results in a mental action.

Let's say one moves his body by properly through the gamepad, through attention and intention.

By using such gamepad one can perform grosser actions such as: `cittasaṅkhāra` [citta actions], `vacīsaṅkhāra` [verbalization], `kāyasaṅkhāra` [bodily actions]. Each `saṅkhāra` has associated an `cetana` [intention]. Those `saṅkhāra` may result in the three kind of actions: actions by mind, actions by speech, actions by body.

What's the problem? The untrained mind has no clue how to skillfully use the gamepad. He does not even know there's a gamepad to being with... He is completely unaware of the intentions behinds his own actions. His attention whirls arround in the rapids of the river of thirst.




# ■ taming animals [practice]

A key simile buddha used over and over again, is the training wild animals [see MN 125 for instance](https://suttacentral.net/mn125/en/bodhi). If a player were to follow buddha's instructions he would see that: the player himself is to be seen as a wild animal that needs to be tamed, the six senses are to be seen as wild animals that needs to be tame... and the player himself, oneself, is to be seen as the trainer of all those wild suffering-pasturing animals


**Meditation is meditation as long as one is taming oneself.** This self taming meditation should be done at all times. The effective way to tame is not let the animals misbehave, not even once.

One tames a wild animal not by words, nor violence, but by forcing them to change their behaviours, their pastures. Habits need reinforcement to keep themselves alive [see MN 18](https://suttacentral.net/mn18/en/bodhi). The trainer should not let the animal to roam the pastures they want, thus those habits eventually dry by themselves in the course of time.


The habit of the untrained wild senses is to be interested with the objects of the game; to step out of the doors to interact with the world at every single opportunity. The first thing one needs to do, then, is to not allow them to step out on their own, but only when the trainer lets them.



## `■■` with ox training, you need the mid pada

One should train oneself by following the `majjhimapaṭipadā` [middle way]. This means: one does not try to delight in the objects of the `saṃsāra` contacted by the senses; one does not try to get rid of in the objects of the `saṃsāra` contacted by the senses. Instead one endures any experience that attacks the senses until the danger fades away [see SN 35.240](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.240/en/bodhi), like a tortoise put his limbs out of the possibility to being preyed by the jackal.


The tortoise does not get angry at the jackal. One does not get angry at the world. One does not get angry with himself. One not accumulate impressions that would the tortoise rumiate the pastures of entretaining such thoughts as he harassed me, he abused me, he attacked me... The tortoise know was under siege by the following_his_own_nature jackal; thus it does not add more misery to his shield by fueling that thirst that has as condition for its arising, the fertile fetters of vanity.

This is the dhamma, and the way to apply the dhamma This is the meaning of:

> Forgiveness-patient endurance is the ultimately austerity.

The key is that the trainer must keep cool, and have a friendly attitude towards the animal, whether the animal is misbehaving or wellbehaving. It is the nature of the wild animal to wrongly pull towards the door. It is the nature of the trainer to forgive the animal, it is the nature of the trainer to exhert himself so that he gives no change to the animal to missbehave. By repeating this over and over again the six senses and the trainer start to become uninterested with the whole game.



## `■■` gocara ■ watch out Y the pastures your ox eats, ox tender

An arbitrary partition of the path in main `gocara` [pasture]... could be the following.



## `■■` sīla ■ no sīla

This is where 99.99% of [nowadays] one is when one `hears the dhamma` , before one starts to practice.

[ the tamer does not know if he should start taming himself ]



## `■■` sīla ■ fencing

Since the animals are full wild, first of all the trainer needs to fence them, so they do not go into intoxication pastures. In this way, eventually, his level of intoxication will subside enough, so the trainer will be able to interact with them.

This fencing is done by forcefully imposing the trainer will upon the animals from coarser miss behaviour to subtler miss behaviours. This would correspond to the coarser application of the precepts in body and verbal miss behaviours.

It is likely one may need to apply subsequent fences, for instance, someone very keen on alcohol may need to fence all pubs, so he don't step into dangerous territory. Someone very keen on the internet, may beed to remove all internet connectivity.


[ the ox doesn't break free from the fences of the tamer ]



## `■■` sīla ■ tending

> In the old days Kuei Shan asked Lazy An:
> 
> What work do you do during the twenty-four hours of the day?
> 
> An said:
> 
> I tend an ox.
> 
> Kuei Shan said:
> 
> How do you tend it?
> 
> An said:
> 
> Whenever it gets into the grass, I pull it back by the nose.
> 
> Kuei Shan said:
> 
> You’re really *tending* the ox!


Once they are an enclosed within a reasonable territory, such territory will inevitable contain wholesome and unwholesome pastures; this is the desirable environment [see MN 25](https://suttacentral.net/mn25/en/bodhi). Then trainer needs to actively tend them so they do not get into the unwholesome pastures. At this stage, most of the times the senses will get out of the door without the training being able to pull them back in time: that's ok, as long as they do not get to eat unwholesome grass.

This would correspond to the subtle application of the precepts in mental actions, such as not thinking unwholesome thoughts [see MN 19](https://suttacentral.net/mn19/en/bodhi) [see MN 20](https://suttacentral.net/mn20/en/bodhi). This stage ends when the trainer is able to pull back the animals before they open the door. In other words; the trainer now is able to properly `guttadvāro` [guard the doors].


[ the ox obeys the tamer if and only if the ox is grabbed by the nose by the tamer ]



## `■■` samādhi ■ tying

After much tending the animals are calm enough that one is able to tie them to a post, without them breaking the chain and stepping out of the door [see SN 35.247](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.247/en/bodhi).

This would correspond to the subtlest applications of the precepts to the subtlest actions by attention and intention, known as sense restrain.

It is not like you can go to sleep, but at least you can sit in the shade of the tree, and when the ox starts looking with apetitious lovely_eyes a pasture, rather than letting the ox go and have a bit of grass (yourself <trainer> past behaviour), the trainer now will be able to see the signs in the eye of the creature and keep it in the dhamma pastures, by hissing a subtle `tssst`.

See the danger in the sligthest fault. Welcoming the *lovely* or proliferations, like those based in *this is so bad he abused me by the mere act of me knowing of its existing* is almost always enough to get the animal in the pasture of breaking the cord in which it is tied to the Indra post.


[ the ox obeys the letter order of the trainer ]



## `■■` samādhi ■ calming

At this stage the trainer needs to calm them, so the animals do not even pull away from the post, but calmly rest near the post. The way to calm the animal is by being calm oneself, not matter if they are agitated. If the trainer is agitated, the animals will get even more agitated. If the trainer is calm, the animal sooner or later, tired of being agitated, will clam down on their own.

This would correspond from eating in moderation to contentment. One should adopt the atitude to surrender to the dhamma, reality, present, six_five... be content with the little the world provides as nutriment, while understanding the nutriment of the body, and of the mind.

The impressions that leave a mark in viññāṇa [as opposed to a mark left to the sea of understanding of viññāṇa , that results in no more accumulation of actions saṅkhāra] are **obstrusive** to the samadhi.

If you are discontent with your without, the food you receive in alms, the weather you get from indra, the health you get from time ... *you won't get in samadhi be it by day or by night* ... you are leaving marks not in the water, that you will rumiate about later, because, unless the marks in the water, those are visible, they can be revisited, pastured...

See the danger in the sligthest fault, in the sligthest mark, whether in the water, sand, earth, or rock. 

Move like a *bee, goes taking honey from the flower, without harming color or fragance* of the different flowers of the world, specially trying not to agitate others, as this agitates way more ourselves, *greater is the harm done to oneself by a wrongly directed mind*.

> like a beautiful flower, brigthly colour, but without scent
> even so useless is the well utter speech of one who does not act accordingly

If you recite about renunciation, sacrifice your wordly hopes, throw them up, eat whatever this bodymin throws up, with no disgust, don't react to it, like maha kassapa eating the finger of the leper. Be real, open yourself, uncover what's covered...

[ the ox obeys the spirit of the taming ... and lies down next to the tamer ]



## `■■` samādhi ■ pacifying

Then the trainer needs to fully pacify the animals. They are lying by the post, but every time something came up within their range, every time an object approached the door, they can't help open the eyes, up their ears, and follow with interest what's going on outside. The trainer needs to teach them to abandon their longing for the world; which is rooted in the interest for sensual pleasures coming from the objects of the world.

Find a suitables sañña glass to train yourself and your citta into getting uninterested of the world, staring from the gross external rupa, from the subtle internal_assumed aggregates like knowing or feeling.


A fletcher straigthen the arrows, not being in a hurry, not doing fast hedless hand work.
So the irrigators with water, so the carpenters with wood...
Thuse, one who tame themselves, should understand he is always working in his precious pottery opera by picking flowers of poetry, and engraving them into one's experiences...

> seeing the body as froth , and thoroughly comprehend it's mirage nature ,
> let one proceed unseen by yama , having broken the flower tipped arrows of maara .


Breath recollection is quite nice... specially if you use the neutral, simple, quite stupid knowledge of `i am inhaling`, and of `i am exhaling`, to level up your game skills. Would the world have a problem is we were to wait for the current or `i am exhaling` to finish?

Give you some room before you commands your animals to react, to open the door, to see what they bring you from that assumed external that is very felt internal. If the trainer is always ready to react, the animals will naturally follow. If one does seclusion, [even when he is not in the ideal pasture of being alone in the forest, under a tree], from being ready to react, from being eager to react as soon as something happens, from being ready to change our experience, to push the commands, to accumulate and carry uncountable saṅkhāras...


This would correspond to the abandoning of hindrances and culminate in `jhāna` [meditating beyond the liability of hindrances].

[ the ox is infused by the flavour of tranquility and solitude... the ox stops being liable to be disturbed by the ties, flowers, hooks of the loka , so he goes and can taste the flavour of the super loka pasture ]



## `■■` pañña ■ teaching

Then one needs to show the animal the perils of the pastures they still want to go, but they are not allowed to.

This is done by cultivating the proper themes and perceptions that lead to dispassion, such as death, metta, repulsiveness, no repulsiveness, anapanasati, etc. By examining oneself, seeking for subtle traces of thirst, until the roots are so dried, they are suitable to ignite them.




## `■■` fourth pada ■ fully tamed

Finally the animal won't even think to pull, won't long for the pastures he used to crazily enjoy... it will be fully tamed and pacified. The thirst quenched by not wanting to get involved with the thirst, in first place.

At this point is where the wild animal becomes a `indriya` under the control of the player.




# ■ the path of the dhamma

The dhamma is good in the beginning, good in the middle, good in the end. This beginning, middle, and end are called sīla, samādhi, and pañña.

Some think of sīla, samādhi, and pañña as three axis. They are not. It is just one path, one set of skills. The difference is the mastering of the skills, and whether they are applied to a gross level or an extremely subtle one. An ax and a scalp are pretty much the same item. In other words:


`sīla` [the way oneself conducts] is

* having enough samādhi to not missbehave by body, speech, and mind even once
* having enough pañña to renounce to be commanded by greed, hatred, and delusion in body, speech, and mind actions


`samādhi` [peace on the harmony of the six_five that support oneself] is

* having enough sīla to not even contemplate the possibility to spill your attentions and intentions in the world
* having enough pañña to renounce to missbehave by the subtle attention actions and pulls from the senses


`pañña` [wisdom to see that from the egg of craving arises the suffering of the chicken, and thus does not incubate such eggs, until they become cool, and the chicken dies before being born ] is

* having enough sīla to not wanting to queue up ever again
* having enough samādhi to still all craving for ever




# ■ pañña [what matters: seeing that the egg is the womb of the chicken]

Count and gauge the millions of useless good-for-nothing delusional thoughts people have, suffer because of them, yet they go and incubate more of them, because one is enough interested to care for one's habits by perpetuating them... which results in a never ending flow of proliferation. *[all is vanity and vexation of the spirit]*

> people carry more and more thoughts driven by thirst ,
> 
> having enough already, they still fuel for more ;
> 
> [ Yuan Canon 元藏 y1.5 ]


**pañña is the uprooting of thirst**

From the worldly point of view: this thirst is the very purpose that gives sense to the game of the saṃsāra.

This pañña is no other than the famous let go, give up, relinquish, renounce... This is the last step, and the very first, and the very core. The raze of the wisdom of renounce is the ultimate scalpel that extirpates the cancer of this disease that is called wanting to `bhāva` [become something].

> Look at this painted doll: this pretentious mass of sores, wretched, and full of cravings; nothing of which stable or lasting.
> 
> Wasted away is this body, a nest of diseases, and perishable; the putrid mass breaks up, death is the end of life.
> 
> This body is a city, build of bones and plastered with flesh and blood; a city wherein lies concealed decay and death, pride and hypocrisy.


... a key theme of the teaching is dead ... decay, disease, dead, the endmaker, `Yama` ...
... birth .. youth ...


> M : — For whom is this spreading of grass laid down in the good Bhāradvāja's fire-room? It seems like a recluse's steeping place.
> 
> B : — This has been prepared for that Master Gotama.
> 
> M : — Indeed, Master Bhāradvāja, it is an ill sight we see when we see the resting place of **that destroyer of growth, Master Gotama**.

[ MN 75 ](https://suttacentral.net/mn75/en/bodhi) Other translation choice is to say: Buddha is a mass murder. Gotama is *a destroyer of the youth*, *a baby killer*. He is one who that has conquer the world and points the way out of the cycle of decay and birth by drying the vices, cutting down the whole forest, uprooting the fetters... and make the saṃsāra lose a player.

Māra is kind of saṃsāra Cheerleader who feels sad when one would stop to pay attention to this dance. Before losing you to the deathless, he will try to hook you by showing three interesting things. Mara is the grazing pasture of the hen and the chicken, and enjoy being eaten by their worshippers. Mara is within and without.

*the enemy is at home.*




# ■ sīla [resources]

The gradual training tells you the macro stages you are in. The dhammapada tells you the next concrete behaviorus you should focus to conquer by applying the middle way. The verses of the dhammapada are straightforward to apply...

> Non by hatred are hatred ever pacified here in the world, they are pacified by no hatred; this is the eternal law.
> 
> Others do not realize that we are all heading for death; those who do realize it will compose their quarrels.


Yet they are hard to follow...

> Easy done are things which are bad and not beneficial to oneself; what is beneficial and good that is exceedingly difficult to do.



## `■■` similes — the collection of narrative to recollect and contemplate near mano

citta is a narrative driven creature, so it has sense to tame it through a narrative driven training...


`upa maa` [near_maa ; simile] is putting the mind near the mind, by using the mind to condicione the mind, by using mind to tame mind, by using mind to teach mind. By placing the proper seed of the dhamma in mano, by taking care, watering with love, and fertil nutriment, one is able to interact with the animal.

## `■■` dhammapada

Each verse of the dhamma, offers a clear commandment to follow. Learn them. Play them as it were a room, apply them in every moment of your life, rinse and repeat, until you have conquered such behaviour.

The dhammapada points the path of `Ys` to be follow by showing you: how one direction, the `akusala` lead to suffering; how the other direction, the `kusala` lead to `nibbāna`.

> **The trainer shall make out the well taught verses of dhamma, as an expert picks flowers**.

> **One who has imbibed in the truth**, lives happy with well seeing mind. The spiritual mature delights in the dhamma made known by the noble.

> **Those who have conformed themselves to well explained truth of things**, desirous of the further, will cross over the realm of death, so difficult to trascend.

> Irrigators draw off waters, fetchers straighten arrows, carpenters shape wood, **the spiritual mature tame themselves**.



## `■■` dhammapada ■ tips

You should learn a pair of verses and apply them. Learn the verses in one language you are prophicient and have no trouble to talk it and pronounce it.

**Are you able to conquer the** `Y` of the level of the game corresponding to such verse?

Know that `kusala` means an action, or something, that is `auspicious for oneself ; auspicious for others ; auspicious for oneself and for the others` ... something that a priori is beneficial for the whole universe ...


Know that the things that in each `Y` pull you to `akusala` are these three [ :

`rāga` [ **greed** ; passion , infatuation , attachment ] : wanting to get something in the game

`dosa` [ **hatred** ; aversion, ill-will ] : wanting to get rid of someting in the game

`moha` [ **delusion** ; illusion ] ; wanting to change something in the game. I'd say it comes in three shades, from coarser to subtle...

1. ***maa*** **na** [of_maa], `māna` [of the monkey moon; vanity], vanity in its more subtle level *vanities of vanities, all is vanity*. So, anything that revolves about admiring, comparing, appropriating I, me, mee, mine, oneself, [with respect of the others]. In the canon it is defined it as *seeing oneself to be superior than others* , *seeing oneself to be equal than others* , *seeing oneself to be inferior than others*.

2. **distraction**, `uddhacca` [restlessness] dislike towards stillnes, silence, peace... existencial angst against all the boredom of the holy ᶁamma... In short, one does not want [even to contemplate the not welcoming prospect of the neutral idea] to sit with the animals without doing anything fancy... *abiding in non activity*.

3. **not knowing thinking knowing** `avijjā` [ignorance] thinking you know it is not rooted delusion *when* .. you do not know delusion | you are under the spell of ignorance .. *or* .. when you do not know if it is not rooted in delusion ... Be self honest, know that *you are rooted in blind darkness* and therefore at least *seek a light*, by *cultivating the bright* behaving like the *ariya*, and folloing such role *give up delight in sensual enjoyment*, so you are in position to *cultivate the ७.factors*, `...`
: ]


Thus... it is easy to evaluate oneself in this roleplay game. Just ask yourself.

[ 1 ] Am I always going with kusala at each `Y` game movement?

[ 2 ] How do I know I am always going with kuśaḷa? ... am I deluded?

`[ Y2 ]` apply truth of the dhamma to the big wound; stop fueling more hatred by silence; the truth is the the middle way, the big wound is that where it hurts the most, when oneself has been abused of!

`[ Y3 ]` once one is not bleeding anymore, one applies the truth to heal it; overcome hatred by no hatred; overcome your hatred towards those problems that make you suffer


`[ Y4 ]` stop lurking towards the world looking for pleasure; embrace the training


`[ Y5 ]` renounce the world; embrace renunciation


`[ Y6 ]` know what is part of the dhamma, pasture that; know what is not part of the dhamma, avoid such intoxicant trapping pasture


`[ Y7 ]` in this way you will be safe from the fire of lust that is the main fuel that keeps alive the thirst for the game


`[ Y8 ]` death comes soon


`[ Y9 ]` then birth follows


`[ Y10 ]` just by learning the first 3, 4, or 7 pairs_`Y` verses... were you to follow them, so much will you gain!

this happiness is blameless

`[ vagga 2 ]` is about the attitude one should always carry. One is a trainer. One is chained to those wild animals 247, so one should train them 247.

[:fifth.intoxicant_bow:

the whole point of the whole bow of non intoxication ...
it is not about not drinking even a drop of alcohol ...
it is not putting in those situations, in those pastures ...
that are so intoxicating in themselves ...

would impact the performance of someone who guards something precious ...

with a drinking a bit of intoxicant...
of poision...
trying to satisfy our thirts for intoxication...
then, we can't help but:
* lose the control
* fall into no vigilance
* not being able to tame ourselves and our animals
* thus we careslessly behave like an animal
* to the point that the animals go wild and the womb of our actions are rooted in akusala

day night tend the `OX`

commit to do this very little pasture managment ,
from now, until the last step of the journey .
commit to tame yourself as regards siila , samaadhi, pañña

... be intent on escaping from the pasture of suffering
then
... the nature of the dhamma is such that you will progress in the path of the essential dhamma

## `■■` dhammapada `■ : o` in short

If one follows the dhammapada, one sees that unfolds neatly as a perfect responsive map... it is not to be taken as a straight line, but a N-dimension map that one needs to grind the same rooms over and over again until one is able to do a PERFECT RUN without turning not even once to `Y` akusala.

Death is tomorrow. All the unessential things you have chased in this life will be gone. Then, new game, over and over again.

We can't comply, is fun to play. Māra provides a lot of side missions, we don't get tired of the bait.



## `■■` on tending `citta`

Of the six animals, by far citta will be the most troublesome to tame.

> The mind is frivolous and difficult to control, alighting to whatever it pleases. It is good to tame the mind. A tamed mind brings happiness.

> The mind is extremely subtle and difficult to control, alighting to whatever it pleases. Let the man of understanding keep watch over the mind. A guarded mind brings happiness.

> Far ranging and lone faring is the mind, incorporeal and abiding in the cave of the heart. Those who bring it under control are freed from the bonds of Māra.

What those verses mean? That if one is able to fully guard citta one is free from the bonds of Māra, i.e.: one has attained stream entry.

**Hearing the dhamma and** `yoniso manasikāra` **are the requisites for stream entry.** We all have heard the dhamma over and over again. If we are not stream enters, chance are that is because we lack that `yoniso` attention.

`yoniso manasikāra` [attention in regards the womb] is no other than the trainer being able to *read* the wild animal to know:

1. when the animal wants to open the door before the animal moves towards the door.
2. whether the animal wanting to open the door is rooted in wholesome or unwholesome intentions.

`nivāraṇa` [obstructing, blocking; hindrances] are those five things that block the vision of the trainer, blocking the animals out of his sight. Thus, they hinder the meditation, the self taming.

keep in mind, that not vigilance, heedlessness, being with the vision `[ blocked ; citta being out of side ]`, not understanding the situation, not solving the `Y` by going middle step with the natural order... this is the default state. which means not seeing the things as regard the womb: `ayoniso manasikāra`.



## `■■` useful reflections

Those reflections are nice to recite them daily. They are to be reflected in such similes, like any pious religious good heart people would read over and over again the same passage they like, and then perform in real life, with no fault, the paper of the good Samaritan. Those reflections shall help you not to lose the north.


*I am of the nature of decay, I have not gone beyond decay...* [see AN 5.57](https://suttacentral.net/an5.57/en/bodhi)


*This teaching is for those with few desires...* [see AN 8.30](https://suttacentral.net/an8.30/en/bodhi)


*The eye is burning, sights are burning...* [see SN 35.28](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.28/en/bodhi?)



And as a daily meta reflection for a daily usage...


*What are the three most hard things to do in this training?* [see SN 38.16](https://suttacentral.net/sn38.16/en/bodhi)


[ 1 ] How much have I renunciate today as regards: to indulge in seeing the lovely; with senses unrestrained; immoderate in food; lazy for walking the dhammapada; and with inferior energy for taming 247 the wild animals.


[ 2 ] How much content, happiness, friendly, peace, composed, and silence as regards the world I have enjoyed today?


[ 3 ] Why? If I succeeded, then, I should keep striving like this... Whereas if I suffered... chances are I am not practicing properly the dhamma, because when one acts, speaks, and thinks with a pure mind, then `sukha` follows, as the moon follow the path of the stars.

the dhamma in short

> gotamī, you might know that certain things lead to passion, not dispassion; to yoking, not to unyoking; to accumulation, not dispersal; to more desires, not fewer; to lack of contentment, not contentment; to crowding, not seclusion; to laziness, not energy; to being burdensome, not being unburdensome. categorically, you should remember these things as not the dhamma teaching, not the vinaya training, and not the teacher’s instructions.

the dhamma in short

> ānanda, are all precepts and observances, lifestyles, and spiritual paths fruitful when taken as the essence?
>
> `¿? ¿ ? ¿?`
>
> take the case of someone who cultivates precepts and observances, a lifestyle, and a spiritual path, taking this as the essence. if unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline, that’s not fruitful.
> 
> `Y`
> 
> however, if unskillful qualities decline while skillful qualities grow, that is fruitful.

the dhamma in short

> if, householder, when one strives in a particular way, akusala qualities increase and kusala qualities decline, then, I say, one should not strive in such a way.
> 
> `Y`
> 
> but if, when one strives in a particular way, akusala qualities decline and kusala qualities increase, then, I say, one should strive in such a way.

in other words... keep it simple stupid ; what's not part of the solution is part of the problem ; pasture the dhammapada `Y` ; also, don't pasture beyond the handful of leaves.



## `■■` useful reflections `■ ■ ■ . . . ■ ■ ■`  repetition

In oral tradition, repetition is a thing. There's a purpose for that.

> Do not underestimate good thinking it will not approach me; a water pot become full by the falling of drop of water; the spiritual mature, little by little, fills himself with good.

> Better than a thousand meaningless words collected together is a single meaningful word, on hearing which, one become tranquil.

> Upon hearing the teachings, the spiritual mature becomes calm, like a deep lake, becoming clear and undisturbed.

> If you silence yourself like a shattered metal plate, you have attained nibbāna; no anger is found in you.

Then the composed, unified, non scattered mind may naturally repose on the context you put near to the mind;
like the perception of the inhale and exhale,
like the perception of death,
...


> like the earth he offers no opposition
> 
> like the Indra pillar he stands firm

... , the earth does not sorrow
... , the earth does not wail
... , the earth does not lament
... , the earth does not sin

`paṭiccasamuppāda` is not anything more than applying the `idappaccayatā` perception, this technique over `nāma`, to overcome one's own personal difficulties in the training.

`idappaccayatā` [`[ .. ]`] is nothing more than apply the template `with [: this :] then [: this :]`to describe the natural flow of the things, the natural order.

# ■ tip on learning verses

If you were to learn the dhamma, try learning bite by bite, from the pasture of the dhammapada.

If you were to learn suttas, make sure you learn the whole sutta by heart, including the `...`. At the beginning learn only the `pieces` that are relevant to the practice. Once you have apply enough in the practice, learn a bit more of the context, if you think more knowledge will help you in your tending citta.

Know a bit of [prosody](https://ancient-buddhist-texts.net/Textual-Studies/Pali-Prosody/Pali-Prosody.pdf), I recommend to mark the short syllables with a small line, similar to the rūpa of the digit "one" and a kind of curvy line, similar to the rūpa of the digit "two". The main thing to know `e` and `o` tend to read short in a `[cec]`, `[coc]` syllable but long in `[cee]` and `[coo]` just like `[cā]` is `[caa]`.

Try listening someone you like reciting and recite like them. I suggest you [Girimānanda Sutta by Dhammaruwan ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guN5qMeuv70) and the [Dhammapada by Colombo Dhamma Friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN2_VgJ0Qso&list=PLIqIzb1e84AXCQ72dQQt7Z3W7JqpFvv-M).

I strongly discourage this... but if you were to write the `pāli`, do it by hand, at least. Use a language where all syllables are like `[cv]` or `[cvc]`, where `c` and `v` are one mark, one character wide. The easiest solution is rather than using `h` is to have a version of `kgcjtdpb`, with some ligature at the end trace. In the same way is better to avoid `ḍ` and use some distinctive variation within one natural trace, rather than `punctuating` the letter, that breaks the natural flow of writing.

If you were to learn the `pāli`, try understanding the dhammapada and the DN2 by heart, each word, each root. The [grammar form of the dhammapada](http://buddhism.lib.ntu.edu.tw/BDLM/en/lesson/pali/lesson_pali3.jsp), some [words of the Buddha paired to the English counterpart](https://www.buddha-vacana.org/), some [dictionary](https://dpdict.net/?q=manasau), some list of roots [list_1](https://archive.org/details/ThePaliRootsInSaddaniti/), [list_2](https://archive.org/details/b.-bhikkhus-root-bible), [list_3](https://archive.org/details/palidhatupathadh00andeuoft/page/18/mode/2up). If you learn this mirrored the brain has enough pasture to learn the language sooner than later.


The dhamma is a template as a language itself. Apply the dhamma to your problems.

Be practical; diagnose, cure, and live, practicing the damma.

> Don't be heedless!

# ■ sammādiṭṭhi [recap]

> What would you opine of a bunch of Christians that would be very offend if Christ happens to resurrect in the here_and_now and preach what preached in the there_and_then? Either is `😈` or is quite `😈`\-ish.

...

> What do you opine of a bunch of practitioners of the dhamma that are offended if the words of the buddha are being preached as being the truth of the dhamma?

...

The dhamma that worked there_and_then is the very same that works here_and_now.

...

By the way... what is a nice approach to the *dilema* of what to do of the *right view*; the foreruner limb of the `airya` eight limb `magga`... Knowing I am not noble at all, by definition, I have no right view, whatsoever...


These are some helpful mundane narratives to keep in mind for not to end trapped in a net of views...

0. as regards sammādiṭṭhi; the only way to find something is to keep seeking for it until one finds it.

1. as regards training oneself; to know one is delusional and needs to be constantly vigilant to step by step walk the dhammapada

2. as regards bodily actions; to treat any other better than one would treat oneself.

3. as regards `vacīsaṅkhāra` [ actions by speech, whether internal or external ]; suppose a mendicant wearing rag robes sees a rag by the side of the road; they’d hold it down with the left foot, spread it out with the right foot, tear out what was intact, and take it away with them; n the same way, at that time you should ignore that person’s impure behavior by way of body and focus on their [pure behavior by way of speech](https://suttacentral.net/an5.162/en/bodhi).

4. as regards `views` [ diṭṭhi ; dṛṣṭi ]; pacify your views ... don't get emotionally involved with your views... [whatever has arise is dependently originated, anicca, dukkha, anatta](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/AN/AN10_93.html) and [having abandoned conceit  illusion, by what means would he go, he isn’t involved](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp4_3.html) and *victory begets hatred, the defeated one experience suffering; the tranquil one experiences happiness .. giving up victory and defeat*.


> do what is right at a given moment and leave it behind


If you were to learn verses... as part of the training, according how it was done in the times of buddha... the right intention is to remember that this is just the first step, the one that enables the skillfully subsequent step, from moment to moment.

> He who for his own benefit recites the beneficial things ,
>  
> but does not act accordingly ,
>  
> that foolish man ,
>  
> like a cowherd that counts the cows of others ,
>  
> he ;
>  
> is not enriched by the ascetic pada.
