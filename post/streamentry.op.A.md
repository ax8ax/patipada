The teachings in three simple `pada` [a step covering a quarter] of three different `sutta` [well taught verses of truth], the three stages:

1. don't abandon yourself to unvigilance
2. be on your guard against bodily agitation, mental agitation, verbal agitation
3. those who bring the mind under control are freed from the bonds of Māra

This is an introduction for beginners about the essential guideline for working towards stream entry. There are three motivations for this.

`[ 1 ]` The post is explained as it was a `video_game`, a `roleplay_game`. I think some people would greatly benefit if they try to role\_play all\_day to act as buddha himself would act in a vr-chat universe. Larp as a buddha, until you succeed to be like one. This will make you happy.

`[ 2 ]` This community loves map. The buddha's teachings lay down two detailed maps to help one to walk from the darkness of ignorance to the freedom from suffering... One of them is completely ignored as a map! Of not use, a mere ornamental piece of pottery. Still... worse, the other, while being recognized as a map, it is looked down as a map! Or at being something very different, and just vaguely related, to the very pointing towards the solution...

In a lot of whathever\_buddhism the maps are even looked down. Not just disbelief, but in some point as being suspicious that the buddha, the wheel turning dhamma, and his sādhana, would even encapsulated the *stupid-proof guide\_of\_how\_to pass the game*.

it can be like this ...

> — "It can be like that, *[celibacy is not obtrusive for oneself ...]*"

> — "Whatever. *[I love music]*

> — "I like it better like this: *[...]*

> *[randoms from the suttas that upon hearing the dhamma from the mouth of the buddha made a wrong turn]*

... or like this ...

> When it comes to the Dhamma, we have to understand that our opinions are one thing; the Dhamma is something else.  
*[Ajahn Chah ; in the shape of a circle]*

... which way should we turn in this `[ left Y right]` bifurcation?

`[ 3 ]` In several and different internet communities of users that follow the teachings of the buddha... a big chunk of the practitioners fall hard to apply the very `first_level` instruction from the gradual training, such as keeping the bows on virtue.

Even more people, yet, fail to apply the very first instruction from the dhammapada.

> He abused me, he beat me, he robbed me, he conquer me!

> Those who entertain such thoughts will not still their hatred.

> `[ dhammapada 1 Y2 a ]`

Do they understand that all the dhamma is perfectly defined in the first pair of the dhammapada?

> Experiences are preceded by mind,

> lead by mind, and produced by mind.

> If one speaks or acts *[or thinks]* with an impure mind,

> suffering follows,

> even as a cartwheel the hoof of the ox.

> `[ dhammapada 1 Y1 a ]`

.. this or this  ..

> Experiences are preceded by mind,

> lead by mind, and produced by mind.

> If one speaks or acts with a pure mind,

> happiness follows,

> like a shadow that never departs.

> `[ dhammapada 1 Y1 l ]`

Therefore, were one to believe the `dhamma` [natural order, flow, truth], the first thing one would do would be to follow the dhamma, by going against the grain of the world, if needed. Thus, happiness follows, otherwise, nevertheless, suffering follows. It follows in the here-now, and it follows in the there-after.




# ■ oral tradition [context]

The teaching of buddha are few, clear, and expressed in beautiful verses. **The teachings of the buddha were meant to be learned, recited, and followed.** They were not meant to be read, studied, and contemplated intellectually.

If one wants to follow the spirit of the teaching of the buddha, I'd encourage all practitioner to learn by heart the few relevant verses to the stage one is working in. The first three verses are the key for sīla, samādhi, and pañña. If one does not know the teachings, how one is supposed to apply them in real life...? It is not possible to apply them.

There are tons of suttas, but everything emanates from three fundamental concepts that the whole early buddhist text gravitate about:



## `■` *the micro mechanics of walking*

* where to put one's feet in each step of the path
* `majjhimapaṭipadā` [the middle path of steps of the trainee]
* [see SN 56.11](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11/en/bodhi).



## `■` *the detailed map*

* the detailed concrete verse teaching oriented map that one needs to perform, step by step, to walk the path of the dhamma
* `dhammapada` [the steps of dhamma]
* [see Dhammapada](https://suttacentral.net/dhp).



## `■` *the macro map*

* the detailed skill attainment oriented map that one needs to conquer, step by step, to succeed in walking the path
* `anupubbapaṭipadā` [step by step path of steps of the trainee]
* [see DN 2](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/bodhi).

What would you opine of a bunch of Christians that would be very offend if Christ happens to resurrect in the here\_and\_now and preach what preached in the there\_and\_then? Either is `😈` or is quite `😈`\-ish.

What do you opine of a bunch of practitioners of the dhamma that are offended if the words of the buddha are being preached as being the truth of the dhamma?

The dhamma that worked there\_and\_then, and that works here\_and\_now. In some dhamma communities internet, if Buddha were to post, their posts would meet ban or downvote `😈 Y :( a [ | ] a :) Y 😈`

By the way what is the right view?

1. with the world; to treat any other better than one would treat oneself.
2. with oneself; to know one if delusional and needs to be vigilant to step by step walk the dhammapada
3. as regards views; [whatever has arise is dependently originated, anicca, dukkha, anatta](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/AN/AN10_93.html) and [having abandoned conceit  illusion, by what means would he go, he isn’t involved](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp4_3.html) and [*victory begets hatred, the defeated one experience suffering; the tranquil one experiences happiness .. giving up victory and defeat*](#).

If you were to learn verses... as part of the training, according how it was done in the times of buddha... remember, this is just the first step, the one that enables the skillfully step, from time to time.
