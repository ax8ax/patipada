[:title: `subject` [ the wise tame themselves .. how to pasture to reach stream entr ] ; `tag` `[: CONDUCT :]` :title:]

The teachings in three simple `pada` [a step covering a quarter] of three different `sutta` [well taught threads of truth], the three stages:

1. don't abandon yourself to unvigilance
2. be on your guard against bodily agitation, mental agitation, verbal agitation
3. those who bring the mind under control are freed from the bonds of Māra

This is an introduction for beginners about the essential guideline for working towards stream entry. There are three motivations for this.

`[ 1 ]` The post is explained as it was a `video_game`, a `roleplay_game`. I think some people would greatly benefit if they try to role\_play all\_day to act as buddha himself would act in a vr-chat universe. Larp as a buddha, until you succeed to be like one. This will make you happy.

`[ 2 ]` This community loves map. The buddha's teachings lay down two detailed maps to help one to walk from the darkness of ignorance to the freedom from suffering... One of them is completely ignored as a map! Of not use, a mere ornamental piece of pottery. Still... worse, the other, while being recognized as a map, it is looked down as a map! Or at being something very different, and just vaguely related, to the very pointing towards the solution...

In a lot of whathever\_buddhism the maps are even looked down. Not just disbelief, but in some point as being suspicious that the buddha, the wheel turning dhamma, and his sādhana, would even encapsulated the *stupid-proof guide\_of\_how\_to pass the game*.

it can be like this ...

> — "It can be like that, *[celibacy is not obtrusive for oneself ...]*"

> — "Whatever. *[I love music]*

> — "I like it better like this: *[...]*

> *[randoms from the suttas that upon hearing the dhamma from the mouth of the buddha made a wrong turn]*

... or like this ...

> When it comes to the Dhamma, we have to understand that our opinions are one thing; the Dhamma is something else.  
*[Ajahn Chah ; in the shape of a circle]*

... which way should we turn in this `[ left Y right]` bifurcation?

`[ 3 ]` In several and different internet communities of users that follow the teachings of the buddha... a big chunk of the practitioners fall hard to apply the very `first_level` instruction from the gradual training, such as keeping the bows on virtue.

Even more people, yet, fail to apply the very first instruction from the dhammapada.

> He abused me, he beat me, he robbed me, he conquer me!

> Those who entertain such thoughts will not still their hatred.

> `[ dhammapada 1 Y2 a ]`

Do they understand that all the dhamma is perfectly defined in the first pair of the dhammapada?

> Experiences are preceded by mind,

> lead by mind, and produced by mind.

> If one speaks or acts *[or thinks]* with an impure mind,

> suffering follows,

> even as a cartwheel the hoof of the ox.

> `[ dhammapada 1 Y1 a ]`

.. this or this  ..

> Experiences are preceded by mind,

> lead by mind, and produced by mind.

> If one speaks or acts with a pure mind,

> happiness follows,

> like a shadow that never departs.

> `[ dhammapada 1 Y1 l ]`

Therefore, were one to believe the `dhamma` [natural order, flow, truth], the first thing one would do would be to follow the dhamma, by going against the grain of the world, if needed. Thus, happiness follows, otherwise, nevertheless, suffering follows. It follows in the here-now, and it follows in the there-after.




# oral tradition [context]

The teaching of buddha are few, clear, and expressed in beautiful verses. **The teachings of the buddha were meant to be learned, recited, and followed.** They were not meant to be read, studied, and contemplated intellectually.

If one wants to follow the spirit of the teaching of the buddha, I'd encourage all practitioner to learn by heart the few relevant verses to the stage one is working in. The first three verses are the key for sīla, samādhi, and pañña. If one does not know the teachings, how one is supposed to apply them in real life...? It is not possible to apply them.

There are tons of suttas, but everything emanates from three fundamental concepts that the whole early buddhist text gravitate about:



`■■■■` *the micro mechanics of walking*

* where to put one's feet in each step of the path
* `majjhimapaṭipadā` [the middle path of steps of the trainee]
* [see SN 56.11](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11/en/bodhi).



`■■■■` *the detailed map*

* the detailed concrete verse teaching oriented map that one needs to perform, step by step, to walk the path of the dhamma
* `dhammapada` [the steps of dhamma]
* [see Dhammapada](https://suttacentral.net/dhp).



`■■■■` *the macro map*

* the detailed skill attainment oriented map that one needs to conquer, step by step, to succeed in walking the path
* `anupubbapaṭipadā` [step by step path of steps of the trainee]
* [see DN 2](https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/bodhi).





# role of similes [visualize , project , self-suggest how to act and meditate]

The similes are there to help one to understand the teachings. The best is to immerse yourself in the simile for a while, and think how would you act in such mini\_game. Bring the alertness, vigilance, energy, and interest you get from that simile to apply it to your meditation. Again; larp, it is of great help.

`[ 1. ]` The simile of the dhamma spiritual journey is: the walker and the path.

The goal is to know where on should be heading and how to safely advance step by step in a jungle full of thorns... to reach a place one does not know where it is, if exist at all...

`[ 2. ]` The simile of training and struggling according the dhamma is: the trainer and the wild elephant bull.

The goal is taming a wild jungle elephant so it marches erect, straight, fearless, and full confident towards his death in an epic battle against the army of Māro, seeing non stop of arrows and formations of shields, sounds of conchs and furious battle drums, smell of blood and death...

`[ 3. ]` The simile of the body-mind-background-environment of the training of the dhamma is: the six wild animals the trainer is chained to.

The goal is that the trainer tied to the six wilds animals join together, and while being closed, the six animals sit down, stay calm, not disturbing anyone, not being disturbed by anyone else, in silence...

Similes are good off cushion, and even better and more effective in a controlled environment conductive to meditate, to do kusala.




# saṃsāra as video game [theory]

**A player** ***passes*** **saṃsāra once stops wanting to play the game.**

The main skill to cultivate is dispassion. The main skill required for passing the game is being uninterested towards all aspects of the game, so eventually one renounce to keep playing, respawn after respawn.

Each `satta` [creature; being] is a player. Each human player is trapped within a `saḷāyatana` [six stretches; six field senses]. This `saḷāyatana` offers to the player a stream of `nāmarūpa` [name form]; all the player can experience from the game are particular instances of `nāmarūpa`.

Each `āyatana` [a stretch] is as powerful as the `vajra` [the thunderbolt; the all mighty weapon of Indra, the Lord of the Gods]. That's why an `āyatana` is also called `indriya` [belonging to Indra]. Unfortunately, the untrained player has no control over such `indriyas`, rather the player is being captive and under the control of the powerful `indriyas`. An `āyatana` is also called an animal... since the senses are alive on their own, have their own wanting, their own likes and dislikes.

In short, an untrained player has the pretension he's master of *this* `satta`, that he leads *this* body from here to there; in fact, he's just being dragged by the wild animals he's chain to, from moment to moment, from life to life. Like in a cartoon, one hits his face every few seconds with a bit of funny `domanassa`.

Rather than confront the painful reality: *I am being captive by the senses, by the body*, the untrained flips the situation by telling himself *I am the master of the body, this body obeys me*.



`■■■■` āyatana, the six wild animals

From distant to near, these are the six wild animals.

1. eye, sights, snake. An untrained eye acts like a snake. When he sees something he likes it, he approach serpently to it, surrounds it, hugs it, and try to eat it with his mouth.
2. ear, sounds, crocodile. An untrained ear acts like a crocodile. When he hears something he likes it he catch it with his mouth and won't release it, not matter what.
3. nose, smell, bee. An untrained nose acts like a bee. It goes flying from flower to flower, running away from the stingy ones, and following the sweet fragrances to taste them with his mouth.
4. tongue, taste, dog. An untrained tongue acts like a dog. When there's prospect of food, he starts salivating, and as soon as the tasty food touch his tongue, rather than chewing and delight in the flavour, he can't help it but swallow as soon as possible, so he can put more stuff into his mouth.
5. body, touch, jackal. An untrained body acts like a jackal deceive oneself to assume what one is not. The jackal in India is seen as a cunning and deceptive animal, similar to the role of the red fox in other folklore. While the other four senses cognize many different objects, the feeling of touch only recognizes one object: one's body. Thus, it deceives the player into thinking that this external object owned by the world, the body, it is really an *internal* object, owned by him.
6. mind, dhammas, monkey. An untrained mind acts like a monkey... jumping from branch to branch. This monkey is called `citta`, which is usually translated in English as mind or heart.

buddha says the six stretches are in themselves hollow. They have no constant essence, they just reflect the external objects they are `phassa` [contacted] with. One does not see them, thus one takes them as I and mine. As a result one goes in a never ending quest of chasing the objects of the world... thinking that is what one wishes, not seeing that those wishes come from the wild animals.

While the senses may be empty in themselves, due the habits, influxes, and stains... those wild animals have a clear strong behaviour and gross palpable desires. When they see, hear, smell, taste, touch, imagine something in the range of their pasture... they insta react! When they like such objects, they step out of the `dvāro` [sense door] to delight in them. When they dislike such objects, they step out of the `dvāro` to get rid of them.

The untrained has no clue he is following the wild animals into their pastures, the untrained has no clue when he steps out of the door following the animal, or whether there was a door at all... Since the wild animals always want to go here and there, one is fully scattered chasing the objects from `saṃsāra`.

buddha says there are five differentiable aspects of the senses. These aspects are fundamentally intermixed, these are the `pañcakkhandha` [five aggregates]: `rūpa` form, `sañña` [carrying knowing] perception, `vedanā` [what causes one to feel] feeling, `viññāṇa` [what causes one to know] knowing, `saṅkhāra` [carrying action] actions.

The `ariya` is one who overwheelms rūpa [is not overwheelmed by rūpa], who masters sañña [seeing the repulsive and the non repulsive at will], who endures vedanā [without accumulating], who understands viññāṇa [by not being deceived by it], and who pacify saṅkhāra [by remaining silent]. He has grow dispasionated towards the world. He has grow uninterested with the world.

There are the practical approaches one needs to adopt to tame the six animals with five aggregates.



`■■■■` the moves of the game

How do you move your body in real life?

The gamepad of this game is very subtle... it consist of the dupla `< manasikāra , manosaṅkhāra >`. `manasikāra` is the faculty of attention. `manosaṅkhāra` is the faculty of intention, which results in a mental action.

Let's say one moves his body by properly through the gamepad, through attention and intention.

By using such gamepad one can perform grosser actions such as: `cittasaṅkhāra` [citta actions], `vacīsaṅkhāra` [verbalization], `kāyasaṅkhāra` [bodily actions]. Each `saṅkhāra` has associated an `cetana` [intention]. Those `saṅkhāra` may result in the three kind of actions: actions by mind, actions by speech, actions by body.

What's the problem? The untrained mind has no clue how to skillfully use the gamepad. He does not even know there's a gamepad to being with... He is completely unaware of the intentions behinds his own actions.




# taming animals [practice]

The main simile that buddha used over and over again, is the training wild animals [see MN 125 for instance](https://suttacentral.net/mn125/en/bodhi). If a player were to follow buddha's instructions he would see that: the player himself is to be seen as a wild animal that needs to be tamed, the six senses are to be seen as wild animals that needs to be tame.

**Meditation is meditation as long as one is taming oneself.** This self taming meditation should be done at all times. The effective way to tame is not let the animals misbehave, not even once.

One tames a wild animal not by words, nor violence, but by forcing them to change their behaviours, their pastures. Habits need reinforcement to keep them alive [see MN 18](https://suttacentral.net/mn18/en/bodhi). The trainer should not let the animal to roam the pastures they want, thus those habits eventually dry by themselves in the course of time.

The habit of the untrained wild senses is to be interested with the objects of the game; to step out of the doors to interact with the world at every single opportunity. The first thing one needs to do, then, is to not allow them to step out on their own, but only when the trainer lets them.

One should train oneself by following the `majjhimapaṭipadā` [middle way]. This means: one does not try to delight in the objects of the `saṃsāra` contacted by the senses; one does not try to get rid of in the objects of the `saṃsāra` contacted by the senses. Instead endures any experience that attacks the senses until the danger fades away [see SN 56.48](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.48/en/bodhi). This is the meaning of:

> Forgiveness-patient endurance is the ultimately austerity.

The key is that the trainer must keep cool, and have a friendly attitude towards the animal, whether the animal is misbehaving or wellbehaving. By repeating this over and over again the six senses and the trainer start to become uninterested with the whole game.

The main `gocara` [pasture] on the training are these:

# postdata: [meta-game meta-reflexion]

What would you opine of a bunch of Christians that would be very offend if Christ happened to resurrect in the here\_and\_now and Christ preached in the here\_and\_now what preached in the there\_and\_then? Either such followers are 😈 or quite `😈`\-ish.

What do you opine of a bunch of practitioners of the dhamma that are offended if the words of the buddha are being preached as being the truth of the dhamma?

The dhamma that worked there\_and\_then, and that works here\_and\_now. In some dhamma communities internet, if Buddha were to post, their posts would meet ban or downvote `😈 Y :( a [ | ] a :) Y 😈`

By the way what is the right view?

1. with the world; to treat any other better than one would treat oneself.
2. with oneself; to know one if delusional and needs to be vigilant to step by step walk the dhammapada
3. as regards views; [whatever has arise is dependently originated, anicca, dukkha, anatta](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/AN/AN10_93.html) and [having abandoned conceit  illusion, by what means would he go, he isn’t involved](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp4_3.html) and [*victory begets hatred, the defeated one experience suffering; the tranquil one experiences happiness .. giving up victory and defeat*](#).

If you were to learn verses... as part of the training, according how it was done in the times of buddha... remember, this is just the first step, the one that enables the skillfully step, from time to time.
